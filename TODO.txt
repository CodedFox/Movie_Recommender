Wish list of movies for users

============================================================================================

a) Display all the information about a user-specified movie. That is, the user should select
 the name of the movie from a list, and the information as contained in the movie table
 should then be displayed on the screen.

Display movie_ratings in /movies/id
Display directs in /movies/id
Display sponsors in /movies/id

Display movie_topics in /movies/id
	SELECT genre_name 
	FROM topics
	INNER JOIN movie_topics
	ON topics.id = movie_topics.topic_id
	WHERE movie_topics.movie_id = @movie.id

	<% @genres = Topic.joins(:movie_topics).where(movie_topics: { movie_id: @movie.id }) %>

	<% @genres.each do |genre| %>
	  <%= genre.genre_name %>
	<% end %>



b) Display the full list of actors, and their roles, of a specific movie. That is, the user should select
the name of the movie from a list, and all the details of the actors, together with their roles,
should be displayed on the screen.

Display movie_casts in /movies/id
Display movie_roles in /movies/id



c) For each user-specified category of movie, list the details of the director(s) and studio(s),
together with the date that the movie has been released. The user should be able to select the
category (e.g. Horror or Nature) from a list.

Display likes_topics in /topics/id
	SELECT genre_name
	FROM topics
	INNER JOIN likes_topics
	ON topics.id = likes_topics.

Display movie_topics in /topics/id
